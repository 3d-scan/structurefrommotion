Structure-from-Motion plugin for CSIRO Workspace
================================================

This project is a plugin for the [CSIRO Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace/) scientific workflow framework. Its purpose is to utilise open source libraries and methods for photogrammetry and point cloud processing.
This project relies on [OpenCV] (http://opencv.org) and [pointcloudplugin] (https://github.com/csiro-workspace/pointcloudplugin). 

This plugin is still in a development phase, but can be used to perform basic photogrammetry tasks and mesh generation. For more details see the following paper:
Mead, Stuart R., et al. "A Distributed Computing Workflow for Modelling Environmental Flows in Complex Terrain." Environmental Software Systems. Infrastructures, Services and Applications. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 321-332.

Feedback and contributions are more than welcome to help expand its capabilities.

Compiling and using the plugin
------------------------------
1. Download and install [CSIRO Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace/download/)
3. Checkout the fork of the CSIRO pointcloudplugin repository from [here] (https://github.com/stuartmead/pointcloudplugin) and follow the build instructions.
4. Download and install [OpenCV 2.4] (http://opencv.org) (or build a version yourself)
5. Check out this repository
5. Launch CMake from Workspace's Development menu to configure and generate the project. This needs to be done from within Workspace rather than running CMake directly as some key environment variables get setup.
6. Compile the project
7. Add the plugin to Workspace through Settings>Configure application>Plugins
8. Restart Workspace and a Structure from motion group should be visible in the operation catalogue.

Instructions for plugin usage
-----------------------------
Examples and usage instructions are currently being written and will be included in the Wiki.

About CSIRO Workspace
---------------------
Workspace is a powerful scientific application framework and workflow editor which has been in development for over 7 years. Originally designed to construct workflows for scientists in the computational fluid dynamics space, Workspace recognises the importance of interactivity, visualisation, scalability, and ease-of-use in a scientific workflow. It ships with out of the box support for things like mesh processing, interactive 3D visualisation, plotting, networking and database access and is designed to be easily extended through plugins. More than just a workflow editor, Workspace offers a natural path from early code development as part of a research workflow right through to the development of standalone applications for deployment to a collaborator or external client.

Workspace is developed by the Computational Modelling and Simulation Group of Australiaâ€™s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Workspace has been developed with support from CSIRO eResearch, Computational and Simulation Sciences and the Digital Productivity Flagship.
