Structure-from-Motion plugin for CSIRO Workspace
================================================

This project is a plugin for the [CSIRO Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace/) scientific workflow framework. Its purpose is to utilise open source libraries and methods for photogrammetry and point cloud processing.
This project relies on [OpenCV] (http://opencv.org) and [pointcloudplugin] (https://github.com/csiro-workspace/pointcloudplugin). 

This plugin is still in a development phase, but can be used to perform basic photogrammetry tasks and mesh generation. For more details see the following paper:
Mead, Stuart R., et al. "A Distributed Computing Workflow for Modelling Environmental Flows in Complex Terrain." Environmental Software Systems. Infrastructures, Services and Applications. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 321-332.

Feedback and contributions are more than welcome to help expand its capabilities.

Compiling and using the plugin
------------------------------
1. Download and install [CSIRO Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace/download/)
3. Checkout the fork of the CSIRO pointcloudplugin repository from [here] (https://github.com/stuartmead/pointcloudplugin) and follow the build instructions.
4. Checkout [OpenCV] (https://github.com/Itseez/opencv) and [OpenCV Contrib modules] (https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib) and build them yourself. You only need the opencv_xfeatures2d module, so I would recommend turning everything else off (additionally turning off the CUDA modules will save a lot of compilation time).
5. Add the opencv/bin directory to your PATH variable.
6. Check out this repository
7. Launch CMake from Workspace's Development menu to configure and generate the project. This needs to be done from within Workspace rather than running CMake directly as some key environment variables get setup.
8. Make the variable OpenCV_DIR point to your OpenCV build directory (the one with OpenCVConfig.cmake)
9. Make and compile the project
7. Add the plugin to Workspace through Settings>Configure application>Plugins
8. Restart Workspace and a Structure from motion group should be visible in the operation catalogue.

Instructions for plugin usage
-----------------------------
Examples and usage instructions are currently being written and will be included in the Wiki.
